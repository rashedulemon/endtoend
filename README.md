# ðŸš€ End-to-End ML & DL Deployment on AWS and Azure

This repository demonstrates a full-stack pipeline for deploying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to cloud platformsâ€”AWS and Azure. It covers everything from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation, containerization, and cloud deployment. Designed for scalable, production-ready AI solutions, especially in healthcare and other data-intensive domains.
